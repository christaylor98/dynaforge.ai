lets compare what we are doing compared to the spec-kit project .. what can we learn from it ... what gaps do we have that we can learn how to close off.  https://github.com/github/spec-kit

I pulled spec-kit’s README and core workflow so we can compare approaches and extract concrete upgrades for Dynaforge.

What Spec Kit Offers

Intent-first specs: “specs → plan → tasks → implement” via slash commands (/speckit.*) and a CLI (specify init, specify check).
Project bootstrap: a repeatable template (.specify/) with memory, templates, and helper scripts.
Structured clarification and checks: /speckit.clarify, /speckit.analyze, /speckit.checklist for consistency and completeness before build.
Multi-agent support: designed to run inside numerous AI coding agents; provides per-agent wiring and readiness checks.
Feature scoping: feature directories and a branch convention (e.g., 001-…) with templates for spec/plan/tasks.
Where Dynaforge Stands (MS‑01)

Governance-first loop: PM→Designer→Implementer→Tester with approval gating (FR‑10), audit trails (FR‑06), and traceability.
Requirements elaboration: deep per‑FR elaborations, acceptance criteria, and demo collateral.
Interaction bridge: CLI/Discord commands (/status, /clarify, /approve, etc.), with routing and logging (FR‑08/FR‑09).
QA policy: rules engine framing is defined (FR‑11) and integrated into the loop.
Gaps We Can Close (inspired by spec-kit)

Spec bootstrap + constitution
Gap: No single “project constitution” or one-shot bootstrap that seeds all working templates.
Close: Add dynaforge init to scaffold .dynaforge/ (constitution, templates, scripts) and seed feature/change folders.
Structured spec→plan→tasks flow
Gap: We have elaborations and an implementation plan, but not an explicit “spec → plan → tasks” pipeline with commands.
Close: Add /df.specify, /df.plan, /df.tasks, /df.implement commands mapped into the interaction stub (FR‑08) and logged (FR‑09).
Clarification and preflight checks
Gap: Clarifications exist ad‑hoc; no formal “clarify/analyze/checklist/doctor” stages before implementation.
Close: Implement /df.clarify, /df.analyze (cross‑artifact consistency, traceability coverage), /df.checklist (requirements hygiene), and dynaforge doctor (tooling/env checks like specify check).
Feature scoping model
Gap: We have CH-### change objects planned (FR‑25) but lack a feature/change workspace convention with templates.
Close: Create changes/CH-###/ with spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md, quickstart.md; tie to traceability and approvals.
Agent portability
Gap: Dynaforge commands exist, but we don’t publish turnkey wiring for popular agent CLIs.
Close: Provide adapters/instructions per agent (Copilot, Cursor, Windsurf, Claude Code, etc.) so /df.* commands are recognized where people work.
Readiness automation
Gap: No single “readiness check” for governance loop and docs.
Close: dynaforge check verifies approvals, QA policy verdicts, audit schema, and doc currency, failing fast with remediation steps.
Quick Wins (1–2 days)

Add a “Constitution” doc (.dynaforge/memory/constitution.md) that codifies principles, gates, and doc standards; link it in PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md.
Extend interaction stub with /df.clarify and /df.analyze that:
Parse elaborations and traceability to flag unmapped FR/WS/TC, missing acceptance criteria, or stale evidence.
Emit actionable concerns (FR‑07) and a gaps table under artifacts/phase1/analyze/.
Add dynaforge doctor to check: Python/uv, git, configured agent CLI, repo structure, QA policy presence, and audit writeability.
Medium-Term Moves (next sprint)

dynaforge init scaffolder that creates .dynaforge/templates, seeds a feature/change folder with spec.md/plan.md/tasks.md, and updates traceability.
Implement /df.plan and /df.tasks to generate a deterministic task list from elaborations and link it to workstreams; log as handoffs.
Add a “consistency auditor” (QA Auditor) that runs with /df.analyze to validate:
FR↔WS↔TC coverage, acceptance‑criteria testability, doc currency, and approval state; outputs Markdown reports.
Publish per‑agent runbooks so /df.* works in Copilot, Cursor, Windsurf, Claude Code, etc. (parity with spec-kit’s agent matrix).
Nice-to-Haves

GitHub Pages or mkdocs site to surface status snapshots and demo collateral.
A “feature runner” that can perform scripted sequences for a change (planning → implementation dry‑run → test) under approval gates.
Environment variable like DF_FEATURE to scope commands (akin to SPECIFY_FEATURE).
Why This Helps

Spec-kit’s strengths are project bootstrapping, spec hygiene, and agent ergonomics; Dynaforge’s strengths are governance, auditability, and QA gating. Marrying the two yields a smooth “spec-to-governed-delivery” path with fewer footguns.
If you want, I can draft:

A CLI stub for dynaforge doctor and /df.analyze (no network, read-only safe).
A .dynaforge/ folder structure proposal with constitution and templates.
An analyzer report format to plug into FR‑11/QA flows.

ok .. what frustrated me with the "spec -> plan -> task" regimentation is that it locked you in, and could only flow one way.  so if you had new ideas, improved ideas, tried major changes ... it was not supported and all this happened outside of speckit, and things quickly got out of sync ... this new system is change centric .. change is baked in, in its DNA, change is welcome and normal ... no one way flows that can't be augmented

You’re right — the fix is to make “change” the primary object so work can start anywhere and flow both directions without drifting out of sync.

Principles

Change-first model: work revolves around a CH-### object, not a one-way spec pipeline.
Bidirectional propagation: edits in spec/plan/tasks/code/docs/UX all produce or attach to a change and auto-propagate impacts.
Progressive approvals: partial approvals are valid; rework loops don’t reset the world.
Always reconcilable: the system detects drift and offers guided reconciliation, never blocks exploration.
Change-Centric Workflow

Start anywhere: open a change for a new idea during implementation, a doc tweak, or a repo diff.
Route + analyze: Requirements Analyst and Impact Assessor tag affected FR/WS/TC/code, then suggest updates.
Update all artifacts in-place: specs, plans, tasks, docs, tests get stamped with CH-### and reconciled.
Gate by maturity: QA Policy and Governance apply right-sized approvals per maturity_level.
Audit + status: every step logs to audit and surfaces in status snapshots keyed by CH-###.
Core Commands (augment, don’t constrain)

/change.new "Title" [--fr FR-XX --ws WS-XXX --scope paths…]
/change.capture --from HEAD~N..HEAD (turn diffs into a new CH-###)
/impact CH-### (analyze ripple effects, risk tier, evidence needed)
/plan.update CH-### and /tasks.update CH-### (regenerate or merge tasks without discarding ongoing work)
/implement CH-### (spawn Implementer runs tied to the change)
/approve|/deny CH-### [--stage …] (partial approvals allowed)
/reconcile CH-### (guided sync across spec/plan/tasks/docs/tests)
/trace CH-### (show FR↔WS↔TC↔Artifacts cross-links)
dynaforge doctor (env + policy + drift preflight)
Data Model (CH-###)

Keys: id, title, origin (spec/plan/task/code/doc), scope (paths, FR/WS/TC ids), maturity_level, risk_tier, status.
Links: affected_frs, affected_ws, affected_tc, evidence (hashes), approvals, qa_verdict, audit_refs.
Lifecycle: Draft → Analyzed → In-Progress → Partially Approved → Approved → Merged; allows loops back on denial.
Repo Conventions

changes/CH-###/ containing spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md, impact.md, evidence.json, status.md.
CHANGELOG.md entries mirror CH-### plus audit refs.
Existing elaborations already support “Linked Change” — keep that field mandatory for edits.
What this closes that spec-kit doesn’t

No lock-in to a single start node; changes can originate from code or docs and still stay in sync.
Partial approvals and iterative reconciliation reduce the “start over” penalty.
Drift detection turns out-of-sync into a first-class task, not a hidden failure.
Minimal Roadmap

Step 1: Scaffold changes/ and CHANGELOG.md + CH-### schema and stubs.
Step 2: Add /change.new, /change.capture, /trace, /impact to the interaction stub with audit logging.
Step 3: Implement /reconcile to update spec/plan/tasks and raise concerns for gaps.
Step 4: Extend QA Policy to evaluate per-change (risk-tier thresholds, evidence presence) and allow partial approvals.
Step 5: Status snapshots pivot on CH-### views (roll up to milestone for demos).
If you want, I can draft the CH-### schema and example changes/CH-000/ stub, plus the command specs for /change.new, /change.capture, and /reconcile so you can review before we wire them in.

dont get me wrong ... i Love the way speckit breaks down tasks to bite sized pieces and really drive the AI to complete implenentation of its spec ... maybe we reuse this layer within the implementer agent ... and it does this breakdown and uses it to control code generation ... in this its a streamed self contained process ... all these arifacts are ephmeral and we don't need them once code is created .. ie they are a means to an end not first class governed artefacts

Love that direction. We can borrow Spec Kit’s “decompose → execute” discipline inside the Implementer, but keep it ephemeral and change‑centric so nothing locks the team in.

Proposal

Embed a micro “spec → plan → tasks → implement” loop inside the Implementer for each CH-### run.
Treat all breakdown artifacts as ephemeral execution scaffolding; only persist code changes, tests, and a concise evidence summary.
Bind every Implementer run to a CH-### so propagation, approvals, and QA stay in sync with the change-first model.
How It Fits Dynaforge

Change-centric: /implement CH-### spins up an internal planner that breaks work into bite‑sized tasks and streams execution.
Governance intact: Approvals (FR‑10), logging (FR‑06), docs refresh (FR‑02), QA policy (FR‑11) apply to the resulting diffs, not to the ephemeral scaffolding.
Exploration welcome: You can rerun the Implementer with new ideas at any point; the system reconciles outcomes back to CH-###.
Artifacts & Retention

Ephemeral workspace: .gitignored path like artifacts/work/CH-###/run-<ts>/
ephemeral_spec.md, ephemeral_plan.md, ephemeral_tasks.json, transcripts.log (optional retention on failure only)
Durable outputs:
Code and docs diffs (on feature branch per FR‑04)
New/updated tests
Implementer summary CHANGE_SUMMARY.md + audit events linking to CH-###
Seeds/tool versions/prompts snapshot for reproducibility (small JSON)
TTL: purge ephemeral workspace after success (e.g., 24h), auto‑retain on failure for debugging.
Interface & Commands

/implement CH-### [--strategy spec-like] [--dry-run] [--seed N] [--max-steps K]
/implement.resume CH-### (continue from last failed step)
/implement.abort CH-### (cleanup ephemeral state)
Events (streamed to audit JSONL):
implementer.step_started/finished, task_generated, file_changed, test_added, verdict_pass/block
Example step event (durable):

{"type":"implementer.step_finished","ch_id":"CH-012","step":"Add schema hash","files":["audit/logger.py"],"tests":["tests/test_logger.py::test_hash"],"duration_ms":42000,"seed":1337}
Acceptance Criteria (add to FR‑04)

Implementer generates deterministic micro‑tasks and executes within a bounded step budget.
Only code, tests, and CHANGE_SUMMARY.md persist; ephemeral breakdown is not committed.
All changes logged to audit with ch_id, artifact hashes, and correlation IDs.
On failure, ephemeral artifacts are retained and referenced in the concern raised (FR‑07).
Risks + Mitigations

Drift between repeated runs: capture seed + tool versions to replay; enforce idempotent writes.
Hidden quality gaps: require at least one new/updated test per affected area; QA policy blocks otherwise (FR‑11).
Over‑automation: provide --dry-run to preview task plan; allow human edit of the task queue mid‑run.
Next Step

I can draft the Implementer design doc and minimal CLI spec, plus patch FR‑04 elaboration to define ephemeral behaviour and acceptance criteria. Want me to prepare those diffs for review?


Perfect — this now converges into a **Constitution change** that formalizes *change-centric governance* and *ephemeral implementer behavior* while integrating Spec-Kit’s micro-planning discipline **inside the Implementer agent**.

Below are **precise change descriptions** to add to the **Constitution component** (for traceability) and instructions for the **implementer** using the **SpekKit-style build process**.
