# Implementation Plan â€” Concern Lifecycle Integration

## Alignment
- Mirror concern entries from JSONL into Markdown summaries.
- Extend CLI interaction stub with lifecycle commands (/ack, /resolve, /assign, /pause, /resume, /promote).
- Integrate QA policy enforcement prior to promotions.
- Provide status snapshots exposing open concerns and QA posture.

## Task Checklist
- [ ] Extend audit logger utilities with concern mirroring helpers.
- [ ] Persist concern snapshots into Markdown for human review.
- [ ] Instrument interaction stub with additional lifecycle commands.
- [ ] Integrate QA policy enforcement to block promotion on open concerns.

## Acceptance Alignment
- Concern mirroring helper produces deterministic Markdown for docs/PROJECT_DETAIL.md.
- Expanded interaction stub logs commands with appropriate metadata.
- Tester artifacts describe pass/fail evidence and pending work.

## Dependencies
- Designer spec approval (Phase 1).
- Updated audit utilities for concern lifecycle.
- Tester-provided fixtures reflecting QA policy thresholds.

## Notes
Design reference: `design/DESIGN_SPEC.md`.
