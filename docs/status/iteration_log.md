# Discovery Iteration Log

| Iteration | Trigger | Key Findings | Follow-ups (IDs) | Human Notes | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `codexa discover --config docs/discovery/config.yaml` (mode=full) | Coverage 68.0% — scope highlights captured in `summary.md`; blast-radius efficiency plan documented (`backlog/efficient_updates.md`) | — | Closed via issue-12 resolution notes | closed |

## Usage
- This table is updated by the Discovery Analyzer and Project Manager after each `codexa discover` run.
- Follow-up IDs map to conversational prompts (e.g., “accept follow-up issue-12”) and to entries in `artifacts/ms02/storyboard/gaps.md` when applicable.
- Humans can append free-form notes in the “Human Notes” column or add commentary beneath the table; the AI will reconcile these notes into the summary row on the next update.

## Manual Notes
- 2025-11-03 — issue-12 resolved by adopting hash-driven blast radius plan (see `backlog/efficient_updates.md`); discovery follow-ups cleared.
