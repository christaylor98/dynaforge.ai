# ðŸ§© Requirement Elaboration â€” FR-06

## 1. Summary
Capture structured handoff logs for every agent exchange, enriching audit trails with `{fr_id, ws_id, tc_id, ch_id, maturity_level, run_id, seed, raci_role, artifact_hash}` and ensuring reproducibility for the change-centric governance model.

## 2. Context & Rationale
Demonstrating auditability is core to the spike. CR002 mandates that each handoff (PMâ†”Designerâ†”Implementerâ†”QAâ†”TQAâ†”GOâ†”HR) records comprehensive metadata so reviewers can reconstruct change lifecycles, Governance Officer approvals, and Implementer retention decisions. These logs underpin FR-26 traceability, FR-27 retention audits, and `/df.*` command outputs.

## 3. Inputs
| Name | Type / Format | Example | Notes |
|------|----------------|---------|-------|
| `handoff_event` | Dict event from agents | `{"from":"Implementer","to":"QA","fr_id":"FR-04","ch_id":"CH-017"}` | Raw payload generated at runtime. |
| `artifact_manifest` | JSON (`artifacts/work/CH-###/run-*/manifest.json`) | `{"files":["docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md"],"hashes":{"...":"..."}}` | Evidence paths + hashes attached to event. |
| `maturity_state` | YAML (`PROJECT_METADATA.md`) | `maturity_level: M2` | Determines required fields (e.g., Governance Officer). |
| `approval_context` | JSONL (`artifacts/phase1/approvals/events.jsonl`) | `{"ch_id":"CH-017","status":"Partially Approved","actor":"GO"}` | Linked to handoff when approvals triggered.
| `execution_metadata` | JSON (`artifacts/work/CH-###/run-*/summary.json`) | `{"run_id":"run-2025-11-01T12:00","seed":42,"duration_ms":58234}` | Provides reproducibility info for Implementer runs.

### Edge & Error Inputs
- Missing `fr_id` or `ch_id` â†’ log rejected with error and PM must reissue event; FR-07 concern recorded.
- Artifact hash mismatch â†’ log entry flagged `suspect`, raise FR-07 concern, and require manual review.
- Duplicate event ID â†’ dedupe while retaining most recent timestamp with note referencing original entry.
- Missing run metadata for Implementer â†’ event stored but marked `incomplete`, retention triggered until metadata supplied.

## 4. Process Flow
```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A[Receive handoff_event] --> B[Validate required fields + schema version]
  B --> C[Enrich with artifact hashes + maturity + run metadata]
  C --> D[Attach approval + concern references]
  D --> E[Write JSONL (audit/handoffs.jsonl)]
  E --> F[Emit metrics + update CHANGE_SUMMARY.md references]
  F --> G[Expose via /status, `/df.*` exports, TRACEABILITY.md anchors]
```

## 5. Outputs
| Format | Example | Consumer |
|--------|---------|----------|
| JSONL | `audit/handoffs.jsonl` enriched event with `{run_id, seed}` | QA, Governance |
| Markdown | `artifacts/phase1/demo/handoff_table.md` summary referencing `CH-###` | Demo collateral |
| CSV / JSON | `artifacts/metrics/handoff_counts.csv` / `.json` with lifecycle durations | Observability tooling |
| JSONL | `audit/errors.log` for failed events with remediation guidance | PM / Governance Officer

## 6. Mockups / UI Views (if applicable)
- `artifacts/phase1/screenshots/handoff_audit_table.md` â€” Table used during demos.
- `artifacts/phase1/screenshots/handoff_retention.md` â€” Example entry showing retention flag.

## 6.1 Change & Traceability Links
- `change_refs`: `CH-002`, plus individual `CH-###` tied to logged events.
- `trace_sections`: `TRACEABILITY.md#fr-06-handoff-logging`, `TRACEABILITY.md#ws-206-change-records--audit-extensions`.
- `artifacts`: `audit/handoffs.jsonl`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `changes/CH-###/status.md`, `/df.analyze` output.

## 7. Acceptance Criteria
* [ ] Every handoff record contains `{fr_id, ws_id, tc_id?, ch_id, maturity_level, raci_role, run_id, seed, artifact_hash}` and optional approval references.
* [ ] Schema validation fails fast with actionable error message written to `audit/errors.log` and FR-07 concern logged.
* [ ] Audit file rotation keeps per-run logs â‰¤ 5 MB while preserving append-only history and referencing retention status.
* [ ] `/status ch-###` renders latest handoffs and `/df.checklist` verifies presence before marking change ready for approval.

## 8. Dependencies
- FR-01 orchestration (producer of handoffs), FR-04 Implementer metadata, FR-05 QA artifacts.
- FR-10 approvals to link gating decisions, FR-11 QA gating, FR-27 retention, FR-28 `/df.*` commands.
- FR-02 documentation to surface summaries, FR-26 traceability obligations.
- WS-02 audit logging primitives, WS-206 change records & audit extensions.

## 9. Risks & Assumptions
- Requires consistent time sync across agents; drift could mis-order eventsâ€”mitigate with monotonic timestamps and `sequence_id`.
- High-volume logging could slow CLI; use buffered writes and incremental flush.
- Future phases will expand schema; design for forward compatibility with versioned schemas and optional fields.
- Sensitive data in logs must be scrubbed; ensure no secrets stored in artifact hashes or summaries.

## 9.1 Retention Notes
- When Implementer sets `--retain`, handoff entries must reference the retained run folder and mark `retained:true` to help Governance Officer audits.
- Purged runs require follow-up handoff entries noting purge completion for traceability.
