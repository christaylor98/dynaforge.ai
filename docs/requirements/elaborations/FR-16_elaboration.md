# ðŸ§© Requirement Elaboration â€” FR-16

## 1. Summary
Stand up an Impact Assessor (IA) agent that quantifies downstream effects of requirement changes, maintains `IMPACT_REPORT.md`, and annotates workstream/requirement notes so approvals proceed with clear risk/benefit visibility.

## 2. Context & Rationale
Change objects often touch multiple requirements, tests, and documentation. The IA agent provides structured analysisâ€”scoring ROI, complexity, and affected artifactsâ€”so the Change Evaluator, Governance Officer, and PM can make informed decisions. CR002 expects this analysis to be serialized per `CH-###` and linked into the approval ladder.

## 3. Inputs
| Name | Type / Format | Example | Notes |
|------|----------------|---------|-------|
| `change_workspace` | Markdown (`changes/CH-###/spec.md`) | `### Impacted Areas` | Source scope for analysis. |
| `requirements_delta` | Markdown diff (`docs/REQUIREMENTS.md`) | `- FR-18 updated` | Highlights changed requirements. |
| `traceability_snapshot` | Markdown (`TRACEABILITY.md`) | `WS-203 row` | Used to locate dependent workstreams. |
| `test_catalog` | Markdown (`tests/TEST_PLAN.md`) | `TC-FR18-*` entries | Identifies affected tests. |
| `historical_metrics` | JSON (`artifacts/metrics/impact_history.json`) | `{"average_duration":480}` | Provides baseline for scoring. |

### Edge & Error Inputs
- Missing change scope â†’ IA flags `analysis_pending`, requests PM clarification, and blocks approvals.
- Unable to map FR to workstreams â†’ log gap, raise FR-26 traceability warning, and include manual follow-up.
- ROI calculation fails due to missing metrics â†’ IA defaults to conservative risk rating and highlights missing data in report.

```

## 5. Outputs
| Format | Example | Consumer |
|--------|---------|----------|
| Markdown | `docs/IMPACT_REPORT.md` entry for `CH-###` | Change Evaluator, Governance Officer |
| JSON | `artifacts/phase2/impact/CH-###.json` with scoring | PM, analytics |
| Markdown | `changes/CH-###/impact.md` appended with IA summary | PM, Implementer |
| JSONL | `audit/impact_assessor.jsonl` record | Audit |

## 6. Mockups / UI Views (if applicable)
- `artifacts/phase2/screenshots/impact_scorecard.md` â€” Sample ROI/risk table.
- `artifacts/phase2/screenshots/impact_dependency_map.md` â€” Visualization of affected workstreams.

## 6.1 Change & Traceability Links
- `change_refs`: `CH-002`, plus the active `CH-###` under review.
- `trace_sections`: `TRACEABILITY.md#ws-202-impact-assessment--evaluator`, `TRACEABILITY.md#fr-16-impact-assessor-agent`.
- `artifacts`: `docs/IMPACT_REPORT.md`, `changes/CH-###/impact.md`, `artifacts/phase2/impact/`.

## 7. Acceptance Criteria
* [ ] IA report lists `{fr_id, ws_id, tc_id, impact_score, recommended_actions}` for each affected component.
* [ ] Change Evaluator receives structured JSON entry ready for ROI computation within the same orchestration cycle.
* [ ] IA highlights missing traceability or elaboration approvals and raises FR-07 concerns when blocking issues are detected.
* [ ] `IMPACT_REPORT.md` entries include links to retained Implementer runs when manual verification is required.

## 8. Dependencies
- FR-15 RA outputs for requirement delta detection.
- FR-23 orchestration triggers to invoke IA automatically.
- FR-26 traceability updates, FR-27 retention references.
- WS-202 Impact Assessment & Evaluator, WS-205 change router.

## 9. Risks & Assumptions
- Impact scoring relies on historical metrics; poor baselines can skew recommendationsâ€”provide manual override.
- High volume of simultaneous changes could overwhelm IA; queue analysis per change to prevent contention.
- Requires consistent naming and metadata across requirements, workstreams, and tests; RA and Traceability must remain accurate.

## 9.1 Retention Notes
- When IA recommends manual verification, ensure retained Implementer runs are linked in the report with reason and expected purge date.
- Once change merges, IA records retention outcome (purged or retained for audit) in `artifacts/phase2/impact/CH-###.json`.
