# 🧩 Requirement Elaboration — FR-03

## 1. Summary
Enable the Designer agent to generate and maintain Architecture and Design specs that translate PM goals into actionable implementation guidance for MS-01.

## 2. Context & Rationale
In the spike, the Designer must provide concrete deliverables (`design/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `design/DESIGN_SPEC.md`) that downstream agents can follow without extra context. This elaboration ensures the Designer captures constraints, edge cases, and demo expectations so the Implementer and Tester can proceed confidently.

## 3. Inputs
| Name | Type / Format | Example | Notes |
|------|----------------|---------|-------|
| `pm_brief` | Markdown section from `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` | `### FR-03\n- expand handoff logging schema` | Primary objective. |
| `concerns` | JSON (`artifacts/phase1/concerns/open.json`) | `{"id":"C-012","topic":"schema drift"}` | Influences design decisions. |
| `approval_notes` | Markdown (`artifacts/phase1/approvals/notes.md`) | `- human: confirm logging retention` | Clarifications to bake into spec. |
| `existing_artifacts` | Markdown | `design/ARCHITECTURE.md` prior version | Allows diff-aware updates. |

### Edge & Error Inputs
- No open concerns → Designer still documents validation that none exist to avoid silent omissions.
- Conflicting approval notes → raise new concern via FR-07 before publishing.
- Missing prior artifacts → Designer creates baseline files with minimal skeleton and records reason.

## 4. Process Flow
```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A[Receive pm_brief] --> B[Collect context (concerns, approvals)]
  B --> C[Draft design decisions & assumptions]
  C --> D[Update ARCHITECTURE.md sections]
  C --> E[Update DESIGN_SPEC.md with steps + examples]
  D --> F[Generate review checklist + open questions]
  E --> F
  F --> G[Log handoff + notify Implementer]
```

## 5. Outputs
| Format | Example | Consumer |
|--------|---------|----------|
| Markdown | `design/ARCHITECTURE.md` component diagram + flows | Implementer, PM |
| Markdown | `design/DESIGN_SPEC.md` scenario tables | Implementer, Tester |
| JSONL | `audit/handoffs.jsonl` Designer→Implementer entry with `fr_id:"FR-03"` | Audit trail |

## 6. Mockups / UI Views (if applicable)
- `artifacts/phase1/mockups/designer_flow.md` — Sequence diagram for MS-01 data path.
- `artifacts/phase1/mockups/designer_tables.md` — Example of scenario coverage table.

## 7. Acceptance Criteria
* [ ] Design spec includes “Happy Path”, “Edge Cases”, and “Demo Script” subsections.
* [ ] All referenced FRs/WSs link back to traceability matrix entries.
* [ ] Designer logs open questions when requirements are ambiguous; Implementer should never receive silent assumptions.
* [ ] Designer handoff includes artifact hashes recorded in audit log.

## 8. Dependencies
- FR-01 orchestration triggers.
- FR-07 concern lifecycle for raising unresolved topics.
- FR-06 logging schema to include Designer evidence.
- WS-101 core loop implementation.

## 9. Risks & Assumptions
- Designer relies on current docs; stale IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN could misguide design.
- Overly detailed specs might bottleneck the spike; maintain “just enough” detail for MS-01.
- Visual assets must stay under repo size limits; prefer diagrams generated via Mermaid when possible.
