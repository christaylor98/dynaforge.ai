# ðŸ§© Requirement Elaboration â€” FR-22

## 1. Summary
Introduce a Governance Officer (GO) agent that oversees QA/TQA outputs, verifies compliance artifacts, and publishes `GOVERNANCE_REPORT.md` prior to granting approvals within the staged gate sequence.

## 2. Context & Rationale
CR002 formalises governance with change-centric approvals. The GO agent ensures all prerequisitesâ€”impact analysis, TQA metrics, retention decisions, `/df.checklist` resultsâ€”are satisfied before approving a change. It also records compliance findings, open concerns, and final recommendations for HR.

## 3. Inputs
| Name | Type / Format | Example | Notes |
|------|----------------|---------|-------|
| `governance_template` | Markdown (`docs/templates/governance_report.md`) | Section headings | Standard report format. |
| `qa_verdict` | JSON (`artifacts/phase3/qa/verdicts/FR-11.json`) | `{"status":"pass"}` | QA policy decision input. |
| `tqa_metrics` | JSON (`artifacts/phase3/tqa/coverage.json`) | Depth coverage | Ensures QA completeness. |
| `impact_report` | Markdown (`docs/IMPACT_REPORT.md`) | ROI & risk | Provides context for decision. |
| `approval_queue` | JSON (`artifacts/phase1/approvals/pending.json`) | `{"ch_id":"CH-017","stage":"GO"}` | Items awaiting GO review. |

### Edge & Error Inputs
- Missing QA verdict or failing checklist â†’ GO must deny approval, record rationale, and request remediation.
- Report generation failure â†’ GO logs FR-07 concern and blocks stage until manual fix.
- Conflicting data (e.g., TQA marked fail but QA verdict pass) â†’ GO halts approvals and triggers reconciliation workflow.

  A[Retrieve pending approvals + evidence] --> B[Validate prerequisites (QA, TQA, IA, RA, df.checklist)]
  B --> C{All conditions met?}
  C -->|No| D[Draft denial, log blockers, notify PM/IM]

  E --> F[Publish GOV_REPORT.md + update change status]
  F --> G[Issue approval event + notify HR]
  D --> H[Update change status to Rework Needed]
```

## 5. Outputs
| Format | Example | Consumer |
|--------|---------|----------|
| Markdown | `docs/GOVERNANCE_REPORT.md` entry for `CH-###` | PM, HR |
| Markdown | `changes/CH-###/status.md` governance notes | Stakeholders |
| JSONL | `audit/governance_officer.jsonl` | Compliance |
| JSON | `artifacts/phase2/governance/checklist.json` | Automation hooks |

## 6. Mockups / UI Views (if applicable)
- `artifacts/phase2/screenshots/go_report_card.md` â€” Example report.
- `artifacts/phase2/screenshots/go_status_cli.md` â€” CLI approval notification.

## 6.1 Change & Traceability Links
- `change_refs`: `CH-002`, plus each `CH-###` reviewed.
- `trace_sections`: `TRACEABILITY.md#ws-204-governance--multi-gate-approvals`, `TRACEABILITY.md#fr-22-governance-officer-agent`.
- `artifacts`: `docs/GOVERNANCE_REPORT.md`, `changes/CH-###/status.md`, `audit/governance_officer.jsonl`.

## 7. Acceptance Criteria
* [ ] Governance report summarises `{risk_assessment, qa_status, tqa_status, retention_decision, open_concerns, recommendation}`.
* [ ] GO approval events include checklist hash and evidence references; denial events list remediation tasks and responsible owners.
* [ ] `/df.checklist` fails if GO report missing for change awaiting HR approval.
* [ ] Governance report archived alongside change record (CHANGELOG entry) for audit retrieval.

## 8. Dependencies
- FR-10 approval gating ladder.
- FR-11 QA policy verdict, FR-19 TQA metrics, FR-16 impact analysis.
- FR-27 retention tracking for evidence availability.
- WS-204 Governance & Multi-Gate Approvals workstream.

## 9. Risks & Assumptions
- GO agent must remain neutral; ensure automation does not auto-approve without explicit evidence review.
- Report format drift can confuse stakeholders; maintain template versioning.
- Large evidence sets should be summarized with links to avoid overwhelming report.

## 9.1 Retention Notes
- GO records whether Implementer runs remain retained after approval; if retained, specify review date and responsible role.
