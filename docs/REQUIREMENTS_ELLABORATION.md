# üß† REQUIREMENT ELABORATION GUIDE

_Last updated: 2025-11-01 ‚Äî maintained by the Requirement Elaboration Agent (RE) and Governance Officer._

---

## üéØ Purpose
All Functional Requirements (FR-###) **must** be elaborated before implementation.  
Elaboration bridges the gap between *intent* and *execution* by producing rich, reviewable context that humans and AI can both understand.  
Approved elaborations satisfy FR-37 (elaboration-before-implementation) and feed FR-26 traceability by linking each requirement to its active change objects (`CH-###`) and lifecycle state.

---

## üß© Core Principles

1. **Every FR is elaborated** ‚Äî no terse one-liners.  
2. **Human + AI alignment first** ‚Äî development starts only after review approval.  
3. **Examples over prose** ‚Äî show, don‚Äôt just describe.  
4. **Reusable format** ‚Äî same structure across phases and projects.  
5. **Living document** ‚Äî elaborations evolve through Change Management (`CH-###`).

---

## üß± File Location & Naming

Each elaboration lives in its own file under:

```

/docs/requirements/elaborations/FR-###_elaboration.md

````

The file is version-controlled, referenced from `TRACEABILITY.md`, and recorded in the owning change workspace (`changes/CH-###/status.md`).

Include a lightweight YAML header to align with traceability ingestion:

```
---
fr_id: FR-###
ch_refs:
  - CH-###
trace_links:
  - TRACEABILITY.md#fr-##
status: Draft
---
```

## üìÑ Standard Structure


# üß© Requirement Elaboration ‚Äî FR-###

## 1. Summary
Short, plain-language description of the feature or behaviour.

## 2. Context & Rationale
Why this requirement exists, what user or system goal it serves, and how it aligns with the project vision.

## 3. Inputs
| Name | Type / Format | Example | Notes |
|------|----------------|---------|-------|
| param | JSON | `{"symbol":"NAS100_USD"}` | Source API request |
| config | YAML | `risk_limit: 0.02` | Strategy configuration |

### Edge & Error Inputs
Examples of invalid or boundary cases and required system response.

## 4. Process Flow
Use Mermaid or simple pseudocode to show sequence and logic.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A[Receive Input] --> B[Validate]
  B -->|ok| C[Process]
  B -->|fail| D[Log Error]
  C --> E[Return Output]
````

## 5. Outputs

| Format   | Example                                | Consumer     |
| -------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| JSON     | `{"signal":"BUY","confidence":0.72}`   | Trader Agent |
| Markdown | `/artifacts/reports/signal_summary.md` | Dashboard    |

## 6. Mockups / UI Views (if applicable)

Link or embed screenshots, wireframes, or quick sketches:
`/artifacts/mockups/fr###_ui.png`

## 6.1 Change & Traceability Links
- `change_refs`: `CH-###` entries that initiated or updated the requirement.  
- `trace_sections`: headings or anchors in `TRACEABILITY.md` that consume this elaboration.
- `artifacts`: durable outputs (`docs/requirements.md`, `changes/CH-###/impact.md`, etc.) updated as part of the elaboration.

## 7. Acceptance Criteria

Concrete, testable statements of success.

* [ ] Valid input ‚Üí correct output in <200 ms
* [ ] Invalid input ‚Üí error logged with code E104
* [ ] Meets UX spec `MOCK-013`

## 8. Dependencies

List related FRs, WSs, APIs, or data models.

## 9. Risks & Assumptions

Identify uncertainties, external dependencies, and mitigation notes.

## 9.1 Retention Notes
Document any reasons to retain Implementer run artifacts using the `--retain` marker so FR-27 retention policies and Governance Officer reviews stay aligned.

## 10. Review Status

| Field             | Value                                           |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Status**        | Draft / Under Review / Approved / Rework Needed |
| **Reviewed By**   | Human Reviewer Name                             |
| **Date**          | YYYY-MM-DD                                      |
| **Linked Change** | CH-### if derived from a change                 |

## üß≠ Elaboration Lifecycle

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  DRAFT[‚úèÔ∏è Draft FR] --> RE[üß† Requirement Elaboration Agent]
  RE --> HR[üë§ Human Reviewer]
  HR -->|Approve| PM[üß≠ Project Manager]
  HR -->|Rework| RE
  PM --> IM[üß± Implementation Manager]
  IM --> QA[üß™ QA Auditor]
````

**Rules**

* Implementation Manager **cannot** create workstreams for an FR until its elaboration is *Approved*.
* Any update to an elaboration automatically triggers a **Change Evaluation** and version bump.
* Approved elaborations must be linked in `TRACEABILITY.md` under the owning workstream and recorded in the associated `CH-###/status.md` lifecycle history.

## üß† Agent Responsibilities

| Agent                                  | Key Actions                                                                  |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Requirement Elaboration Agent (RE)** | Generate/update elaboration docs, including examples, diagrams, and mockups. |
| **Human Reviewer (HR)**                | Validate clarity, intent, and completeness. Add examples or visuals.         |
| **Governance Officer (GO)**            | Enforce ‚Äúelaboration-before-implementation‚Äù rule.                            |
| **Project Manager (PM)**               | Link approved elaborations to Traceability Matrix.                           |
| **Implementation Manager (IM)**        | Decompose only approved elaborations into WS tasks.                          |
| **QA Auditor (QA)**                    | Derive initial test skeletons from examples and acceptance criteria.         |

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Automation Hooks

* **Detection:** PM agent scans `/docs/requirements` for new FRs ‚Üí assigns RE agent.
* **Validation:** GO agent blocks FRs with `review_status != Approved`; `/df.checklist` verifies elaboration linkage before approvals.
* **Change Propagation:** Updated elaborations trigger IA + CE agents to reassess impact, update `changes/CH-###/impact.md`, and refresh trace links.
* **Testing:** QA agent parses ‚ÄúInputs / Outputs / Acceptance Criteria‚Äù to auto-seed test cases and update `TRACEABILITY.md` metrics.
* **Audit:** Implementer logs include references to the elaboration file (`fr_id`, `trace_links`) to satisfy FR-06 and FR-27 requirements.

## üß© Review Guidance for Humans

Before approving an elaboration, confirm:

1. You could build or test this feature **without further clarification**.
2. Examples reflect realistic data and edge cases.
3. Acceptance criteria are measurable and unambiguous.
4. Visuals or flows make the logic understandable at a glance.
5. Dependencies and risks are explicitly listed.
