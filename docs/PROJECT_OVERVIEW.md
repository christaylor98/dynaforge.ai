# Project Overview

## Mission
Build the Codexa.ai framework with auditable agent workflows and human governance checkpoints.

## Current Phase Snapshot
- Phase: `0 — Foundation (MS-01 refresh)`
- Status: Phase 0 foundation regenerated with deterministic evidence captured under CH-001.
- Primary Contacts: Project Manager Agent, Human PM

## Highlights
- Repository skeleton documentation updated to reflect CH-001 foundations and refreshed artifact paths.
- Audit logger replay recorded new handoff entries with `change_id="CH-001"` across the PM → Designer → Implementer → Tester chain.
- Demo bundle (`artifacts/phase0/demo/2025-11-02/`) captured the minimum loop using seed `MS01-P0-2025-11-02`.
- Human-facing docs (`PROJECT_DETAIL.md`, `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`, `VERSION_CONTROL.md`) synchronized with regenerated evidence.

## Next Steps
- Human PM reviews CH-001 Package artifacts (`TRACEABILITY.md`, `docs/PHASE0_DEMO_OVERVIEW.md`, `docs/QA_REPORT.md`).
- Upon approval, Governance logs retention and closes workspace (`audit/retention.jsonl`, `changes/CH-001/status.md`).
- Kick off next milestone planning leveraging validated Phase 0 foundation.

## Approvals
- `✅ Approved by Human 2025-11-02 (CH-001 Spec)`
