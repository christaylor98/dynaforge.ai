# Project Overview

## Mission
Build the Dynaforge.ai framework with auditable agent workflows and human governance checkpoints.

## Current Phase Snapshot
- Phase: `1 — Core Agent Loop`
- Status: Phase 1 orchestration skeleton generated (`make phase1-demo`).
- Primary Contacts: Project Manager Agent

## Highlights
- Phase 1 brief, design, implementation, and QA plans auto-generated for concern lifecycle integration.
- Orchestration loop ensures PM → Designer → Implementer → Tester handoffs are logged with artifacts.
- Concern lifecycle tooling (`pipelines/concern_tools.py`) available for raising, updating, resolving, and syncing concerns into documentation.
- Upcoming work targets concern mirroring, expanded interaction commands, and QA policy enforcement.

## Next Steps
- Integrate concern sync tooling into automated workflows and produce validation evidence.
- Expand interaction stub with lifecycle commands and deterministic responses.
- Wire QA policy enforcement thresholds to block promotions when concerns remain.

## Approvals
- `✅ Approved by Human 2025-10-29`
