# Project Overview

## Mission
Build the Code Overlord framework with auditable agent workflows and human governance checkpoints.

## Current Phase Snapshot
- Phase: `0 — Foundation`
- Status: Phase 0 foundation demo-ready (`make demo`).
- Primary Contacts: Project Manager Agent

## Highlights
- FR-01: Provide a Project Manager agent that captures objectives in `REQUIREMENTS.md`, maintains project summaries, and coordinates workflows across agents. — Enables controlled initiation and traceability of deliverables.
- FR-02: Maintain two PM-authored status documents: `docs/PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` (executive snapshot) and `docs/PROJECT_DETAIL.md` (task-level plan with commentary). — Supports the dual-visibility governance model described in brainstorming notes.
- FR-03: Allow Designer agent to produce and update `design/ARCHITECTURE.md` and `design/DESIGN_SPEC.md`, including responses to `/clarify Designer …` requests. — Ensures architecture decisions are explicit and reviewable.

## Next Steps
- Socialize Phase 0 scaffolding with downstream agents.
- Prepare design briefs for core agent interfaces.
- Confirm audit trail schema with QA stakeholders.
