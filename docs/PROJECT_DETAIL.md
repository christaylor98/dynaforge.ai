# Project Detail

## Scope & Boundaries
Phase 1 delivers the core agent execution loop with concern lifecycle management, human approval gates, and QA enforcement scaffolding.

## Deliverables
- Phase 1 brief (`docs/PHASE1_BRIEF.md`), design spec (`design/DESIGN_SPEC.md`), implementation plan (`docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`), and QA plan (`tests/TEST_PLAN.md`).
- Concern lifecycle implementation (JSONL â†” Markdown mirroring, resolution workflow, notifications).
- Interaction stub commands for lifecycle management (`/ack`, `/resolve`, `/assign`, `/pause`, `/resume`, `/promote`).
- QA policy enforcement wiring that blocks promotion when thresholds fail.
- Demo automation via `make phase1-demo` capturing artifacts under `artifacts/phase1/orchestration`.

## Implementation Notes
- Scenario: Concern Lifecycle Integration.
- Requirements traced from `REQUIREMENTS.md` with emphasis on FR-06 through FR-11 for concern, command, and QA enforcement flows.
- Orchestration script `pipelines/phase1_orchestrator.py` generates briefing, design, implementation, and QA collateral.
- Demo entrypoint: `make phase1-demo` (writes run log to `artifacts/phase1/orchestration/run.json`).
- Concern lifecycle mirroring available via `pipelines/concern_tools.py sync`; next step is integrating it into automated workflows.
- Interaction stub covers lifecycle commands (`/ack`, `/resolve`, `/assign`, `/pause`, `/resume`, `/promote`); sample transcripts stored under `artifacts/phase1/commands/`.
- Upcoming implementation tasks: QA enforcement integration, status snapshots, pause/resume tooling.
