# Project Detail

## Scope & Boundaries
Phase 0 covers repository structure, audit primitives, interaction stub, and foundational documentation.

## Deliverables
- Updated project overview and detail documents.
- Verified audit logger with sample entries and test coverage.
- Interaction stub supporting `/status` and `/clarify`.
- Demo automation via `make demo` and audit summary via `make audit`.

## Implementation Notes
- Requirements digested from `REQUIREMENTS.md`:
- FR-01: Provide a Project Manager agent that captures objectives in `REQUIREMENTS.md`, maintains project summaries, and coordinates workflows across agents. — Enables controlled initiation and traceability of deliverables.
- FR-02: Maintain two PM-authored status documents: `docs/PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` (executive snapshot) and `docs/PROJECT_DETAIL.md` (task-level plan with commentary). — Supports the dual-visibility governance model described in brainstorming notes.
- FR-03: Allow Designer agent to produce and update `design/ARCHITECTURE.md` and `design/DESIGN_SPEC.md`, including responses to `/clarify Designer …` requests. — Ensures architecture decisions are explicit and reviewable.
- FR-04: Ensure Implementer agents generate code artifacts per approved design, attach handoff metadata, and respect policy-defined branch naming (`phaseX/<agent>`). — Keeps execution aligned with design intent and audit expectations.
- FR-05: Provide Tester agent ownership of `tests/TEST_PLAN.md`, `tests/TEST_RESULTS.md`, and `tests/TEST_RESULTS_DETAIL.md`, capturing coverage, reproducibility, and drift metrics. — Delivers evidence-driven quality gates.
- FR-06: Log every inter-agent handoff as structured JSON (`/audit/handoff_*.json`) containing origin, destination, summary, impact level, and referenced artifacts. — Required for auditability and governance.
- FR-07: Record concerns via a standardized API (`log_concern`) that writes to `/audit/concerns.jsonl`, mirrors entries into `PROJECT_DETAIL.md`, and notifies Discord (`#agent-concerns`). — Supports rapid escalation and human awareness.
- FR-08: Implement a Discord bridge that supports outbound alerts and inbound commands (`/status`, `/clarify`, `/ack`, `/resolve`, `/assign`, `/pause`, `/resume`, `/promote`). — Enables human-in-the-loop governance without leaving chat.
- FR-09: Track Discord commands in `/audit/commands.jsonl` and ensure targeted agents respond or adjust workflow accordingly. — Maintains full command audit trail and accountability.
- FR-10: Enforce human approval for project plan changes, high-impact variations, and phase promotions; approvals must be captured inline in Markdown artifacts. — Provides governance gates that align with the defined oversight model.
- FR-11: Integrate a policy/QA engine that evaluates QA results against thresholds (coverage, reproducibility, drift) before permitting merges to `develop`. — Replaces manual PR review with evidence-based gating.
- FR-12: Support GitOps workflows with protected `main` and `develop` branches, structured commit metadata, and automated tagging (`v0.x-phaseY`) upon promotion. — Ensures consistent release management and traceability.
- FR-13: Produce regular status snapshots (`status.json`, dashboards, or Markdown digests) summarizing phase progress, open concerns, and key metrics. — Keeps human supervisor informed between active interactions.
- FR-14: Provide rollback or pause mechanisms (`/pause`, `/resume`, automatic revert scripts) when QA gates fail or critical concerns arise. — Delivers safety controls for autonomous operations.
- Refresh documentation by running `python3 agents/project_manager.py` (idempotent).
- Demo workflow validated via `make demo`; outputs stored under `artifacts/phase0/demo`.
- Audit summary available with `make audit`.

## Review Checklist
- Validation artifacts attached and verified.
- Outstanding concerns logged with resolution notes.
- Human approval recorded with timestamp.
