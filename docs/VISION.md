# Dynaforge.ai Vision

## Mission
Create an autonomous, multi-agent engineering workshop that can design, implement, test, and refine software systems while keeping a human supervisor in authoritative control over direction, quality, and release decisions.

## Guiding Pillars
- **Autonomy within guardrails**: Project Manager, Designer, Implementer, and Tester agents operate independently day-to-day, but their actions are bounded by explicit policies, QA gates, and human approvals.
- **Evidence-driven quality**: Promotion decisions rely on reproducible QA results, drift analysis, and audit trails instead of subjective code review.
- **Human-as-governor**: The human reviewer directs phases, approves plans, and adjudicates high-impact variations through Discord commands and structured handoffs.
- **Transparency and auditability**: Every artifact, handoff, concern, and command is logged, traceable, and version-controlled.
- **Adaptive governance**: Change management and maturity gating scale process rigor as the product evolves, keeping automation aligned with human intent.
- **Continuous improvement**: QA metrics, concern trends, and policy feedback loops drive iterative upgrades of both process and product.

## Desired Outcomes
- Agents deliver end-to-end engineering cycles (requirements → design → implementation → testing → QA) with minimal human intervention.
- Humans maintain situational awareness and can query or redirect work instantly via the Discord bridge (`/status`, `/clarify`, `/promote`, etc.).
- Quality gates and policy engines provide objective readiness signals for merges, promotions, and releases.
- Audit logs and Markdown summaries create a living record of project decisions, risks, and approvals.
- The framework can scale to multiple concurrent projects while preserving governance, reproducibility, and observability.

## Operating Model (Phase 1 Scope)
1. Project Manager orchestrates the RA→IA→IM→QA→TQA→GO loop, keeps `REQUIREMENTS_1_1.md` current, reads maturity metadata, and ensures change objects and metrics are captured.
2. Requirements Analyst monitors requirement deltas, refreshes traceability artifacts, and raises impact summaries.
3. Impact Assessor quantifies downstream effects, maintains `IMPACT_REPORT.md`, and flags ripple risks for downstream agents.
4. Implementation Manager decomposes objectives into `WS-*` tasks, tracks execution evidence in `IM_PROGRESS.md`, and coordinates with the Project Manager.
5. Designer produces architecture and interface specifications (`design/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `design/DESIGN_SPEC.md`) and answers clarification requests.
6. Implementers generate code artifacts aligned with approved designs, emitting structured handoff records for every major change.
7. Test Synthesizer and Tester agents co-own `tests/TEST_PLAN.md`, `tests/TEST_RESULTS.md`, and `tests/TEST_RESULTS_DETAIL.md`, ensuring deterministic QA execution and fresh coverage.
8. QA Auditor validates FR↔WS↔TC linkage, while the Test Quality Assessor evaluates depth against risk tiers and maturity expectations.
9. Governance Officer oversees compliance, maturity gate reviews, and approval workflows, partnering with the Change Evaluator and Vision Validator to keep work aligned with strategic intent.
10. Human reviewer approves project plans, high-impact variations, and test completion, and can pause/resume agents or demand clarifications at any time.

## Adaptive Change & Maturity Management
- Every change is represented as a structured `CH-###` entry recorded in `CHANGELOG.md`, with partial approvals and rationale captured for audit.
- Project maturity is declared in `PROJECT_METADATA.md`; agents scale their enforcement (from lightweight M0 spikes to full M4 compliance) based on this signal.
- The Change Evaluator supplies ROI and disruption guidance (recommendations remain advisory), while the Vision Validator confirms alignment with the mission before major shifts proceed.
- Governance Officer-led maturity reviews and the CLI/dashboard metrics (change density, lag, stability, vision drift) give humans rapid insight into system health.

## Phased Evolution
| Phase | Focus | Key Capabilities |
| ----- | ----- | ---------------- |
| Phase 0 | Repository skeleton and audit primitives | Folder layout, command stubs, JSONL logging baseline. |
| Phase 1 | Core agent loop + QA gatekeeper | Autonomous PM/Designer/Implementer/Tester agents, policy-enforced merges. |
| Phase 2 | CI/CD and observability integration | Build/test environments, linting, dashboards, drift detection alerts. |
| Phase 3 | Self-tuning autonomy | Continuous learning from QA metrics, adaptive policies, broader agent roles. |

## Success Metrics
- Human approves promotions based on `QA_REPORT.md` evidence instead of manual diff inspection.
- All concerns raised by agents are acknowledged in Discord within the defined SLA (<30 seconds for critical alerts).
- Reproducibility of QA runs ≥ 95% and coverage remains above policy thresholds (e.g., ≥ 80%).
- Every phase transition is documented with tagged releases (`v0.x-phaseY`) and associated audit manifests.
