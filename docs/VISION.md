# Code Overlord Vision

## Mission
Create an autonomous, multi-agent engineering workshop that can design, implement, test, and refine software systems while keeping a human supervisor in authoritative control over direction, quality, and release decisions.

## Guiding Pillars
- **Autonomy within guardrails**: Project Manager, Designer, Implementer, and Tester agents operate independently day-to-day, but their actions are bounded by explicit policies, QA gates, and human approvals.
- **Evidence-driven quality**: Promotion decisions rely on reproducible QA results, drift analysis, and audit trails instead of subjective code review.
- **Human-as-governor**: The human reviewer directs phases, approves plans, and adjudicates high-impact variations through Discord commands and structured handoffs.
- **Transparency and auditability**: Every artifact, handoff, concern, and command is logged, traceable, and version-controlled.
- **Continuous improvement**: QA metrics, concern trends, and policy feedback loops drive iterative upgrades of both process and product.

## Desired Outcomes
- Agents deliver end-to-end engineering cycles (requirements → design → implementation → testing → QA) with minimal human intervention.
- Humans maintain situational awareness and can query or redirect work instantly via the Discord bridge (`/status`, `/clarify`, `/promote`, etc.).
- Quality gates and policy engines provide objective readiness signals for merges, promotions, and releases.
- Audit logs and Markdown summaries create a living record of project decisions, risks, and approvals.
- The framework can scale to multiple concurrent projects while preserving governance, reproducibility, and observability.

## Operating Model (Phase 1 Scope)
1. Project Manager synthesizes goals into `REQUIREMENTS.md`, maintains `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` and `PROJECT_DETAIL.md`, and coordinates all handoffs.
2. Designer produces architecture and interface specifications (`design/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `design/DESIGN_SPEC.md`) and answers clarification requests.
3. Implementers generate code artifacts aligned with approved designs, emitting structured handoff records for every major change.
4. Testers own `tests/TEST_PLAN.md`, `tests/TEST_RESULTS.md`, and `tests/TEST_RESULTS_DETAIL.md`, ensuring deterministic QA execution.
5. Human reviewer approves project plans, high-impact variations, and test completion, and can pause/resume agents or demand clarifications at any time.

## Phased Evolution
| Phase | Focus | Key Capabilities |
| ----- | ----- | ---------------- |
| Phase 0 | Repository skeleton and audit primitives | Folder layout, command stubs, JSONL logging baseline. |
| Phase 1 | Core agent loop + QA gatekeeper | Autonomous PM/Designer/Implementer/Tester agents, policy-enforced merges. |
| Phase 2 | CI/CD and observability integration | Build/test environments, linting, dashboards, drift detection alerts. |
| Phase 3 | Self-tuning autonomy | Continuous learning from QA metrics, adaptive policies, broader agent roles. |

## Success Metrics
- Human approves promotions based on `QA_REPORT.md` evidence instead of manual diff inspection.
- All concerns raised by agents are acknowledged in Discord within the defined SLA (<30 seconds for critical alerts).
- Reproducibility of QA runs ≥ 95% and coverage remains above policy thresholds (e.g., ≥ 80%).
- Every phase transition is documented with tagged releases (`v0.x-phaseY`) and associated audit manifests.
