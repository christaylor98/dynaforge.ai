      "A milestone is a curated slice of requirements across phases that results in a system a human can exercise end-to-end; it must be testable and usable, even if only a small subset of total scope is complete.",
      "Milestones may take the form of spikes/POCs, betas, or full releases. Percent completion of requirements is less important than demonstrating a coherent workflow a real user can trial.",
      "Delivery cadence is driven by the human stakeholder: we request the next milestone definition from them and focus the workstreams, requirements, and tests in this matrix around that target until accepted."
