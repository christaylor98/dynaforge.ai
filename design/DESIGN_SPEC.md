# Design Spec â€” Concern Lifecycle Integration

## Objective
Implement concern lifecycle mirroring, lifecycle commands, and QA enforcement gates.

## Context
Phase 0 established the repository skeleton and logging primitives. Phase 1 must now operationalize the full agent loop with concern tracking, human approvals, and policy enforcement.

## Focus Areas
- Mirror concern entries from JSONL into Markdown summaries.
- Extend CLI interaction stub with lifecycle commands (/ack, /resolve, /assign, /pause, /resume, /promote).
- Integrate QA policy enforcement prior to promotions.
- Provide status snapshots exposing open concerns and QA posture.

## Proposed Components
- Concern ingestion service reading JSONL audit entries.
- Markdown synchronizer updating project detail summaries.
- Command router extension acknowledging concern lifecycle commands.

## Deliverables
- Phase 1 brief, design spec, implementation plan, and QA plan.
- `make phase1-demo` executing orchestrated workflow.
- Artifacts under `artifacts/phase1/` evidencing the loop.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Concern mirroring helper produces deterministic Markdown for docs/PROJECT_DETAIL.md.
- Expanded interaction stub logs commands with appropriate metadata.
- Tester artifacts describe pass/fail evidence and pending work.

## Interfaces & Data Contracts
| Component | Interface | Notes |
| --------- | --------- | ----- |
| Concern Logger | `audit.log_concern` | Append-only JSONL record for raised concerns. |
| Markdown Synchronizer | `sync_concerns(concerns.jsonl, docs/PROJECT_DETAIL.md)` | Mirrors open/resolved state into docs. |
| Interaction Stub | `/ack`, `/resolve`, `/assign` handlers | Extend CLI bridge with deterministic responses. |

## Traceability
