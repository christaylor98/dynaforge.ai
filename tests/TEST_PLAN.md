# Test Plan — Phase 1

## Scenario — Concern Lifecycle Integration
Implement concern lifecycle mirroring, lifecycle commands, and QA enforcement gates.

## Objectives
- Validate concern logging mirrors into Markdown summaries.
- Exercise interaction stub lifecycle commands for deterministic responses.
- Confirm QA policy enforcement blocks promotions on open concerns.

## Test Strategy
- Unit tests for concern synchronization utilities.
- Integration walk-through via `make phase1-demo` (orchestrator run).
- Manual verification of pause/resume and approval gating paths.

## Environments
- Local developer workstation (Python 3.11+).
- Continuous integration pipeline (TBD) with audit artifact capture.

## Entry Criteria
- Phase 1 design and implementation plans approved by human reviewer.
- Concern lifecycle helpers available in the codebase.
- Interaction stub expanded with lifecycle commands.

## Exit Criteria
- All critical tests passing with evidence stored under `artifacts/phase1/`.
- No unresolved high/critical concerns in `audit/concerns.jsonl`.
- Approval marker recorded in documentation.

## Test Cases (Draft)
| ID | Description | Type | Expected Evidence |
| -- | ----------- | ---- | ----------------- |
| TC-101 | Sync open concerns to Markdown and verify table contents | Functional | `tests/test_concern_tools.py` pass + rendered Markdown snippet |
| TC-102 | Issue `/ack` and `/resolve` via stub, confirm audit log entries | Integration | `artifacts/phase1/demo/commands.jsonl` capture |
| TC-103 | Introduce failing QA results to trigger policy block and concern | Negative | `tests/test_policy_parser.py` extension + concern record |
