# Project Progress Snapshot

## Status Overview
- Phase: `1 — Core Agent Loop`
- Current focus: implementing concern lifecycle, approval gates, and expanded interaction commands.
- Latest demo: `make phase1-demo` (artifacts under `artifacts/phase1/orchestration/` with idempotent run log).

## Completed Milestones
- **Phase 1 Plan & Brief** — Approved and published (`docs/PHASE1_PLAN.md`, `docs/PHASE1_BRIEF.md`).
- **Multi-Agent Orchestration (WS-101)** — Orchestrator runs logged twice with identical SHA digests (`artifacts/phase1/orchestration/run.log`).
- **Concern Lifecycle Toolkit (WS-102 foundations)** — Added `pipelines/concern_tools.py`, Markdown sync markers in `docs/PROJECT_DETAIL.md`, and unit coverage (`tests/test_concern_tools.py`).
- **Approval Gate Enforcement (WS-103)** — Orchestrator now requires approval markers; denial evidence stored at `artifacts/phase1/approvals/denied.txt` with tests in `tests/test_phase1_orchestrator.py`.
- **Interaction Stub Expansion (WS-105)** — Lifecycle commands implemented with audit logging and tests (`pipelines/interaction_stub.py`, `tests/test_interaction_stub.py`); sample transcripts captured in `artifacts/phase1/commands/`.

## In Progress / Upcoming
- Automate concern raise/update/resolve demonstration and sync evidence (complete WS-102 validation).
- Build QA enforcement workflow (WS-104) integrating policy gates and concern escalation.
- Generate status snapshot tooling for `/status` parity (WS-106).
- Implement pause/resume + rollback helpers (WS-107) and consolidate Phase 1 QA report (WS-108).

## Notable Artifacts
- `artifacts/phase1/orchestration/run.log` — Idempotent orchestrator runs.
- `artifacts/phase1/approvals/denied.txt` — Approval gate denial record.
- `artifacts/phase1/commands/` — Interaction command responses and combined log.
- `audit/commands.jsonl` — Expanded command audit entries.

## Next Actions
- Execute concern lifecycle CLI to produce audit + Markdown evidence.
- Extend policy parser to enforce thresholds and raise concerns on failure.
- Update documentation/QA report once validation artifacts are produced.
